Hi, I'm a developer that makes scripts for quite a bit of games, or does big projects (And probs wont finish them anyway lol) with a twist like I'm trying to make an OS in a web borwser,
Like an emulation of a new Operating system. I also play chess, where I have 2113 ELO as of 22:03 GMT, 8th October 2024
